### Description
The site is meant to bridge the gap learners and teachers. We enable students find their best suitable tutors while also marketing tutors . At a fee students will get to reach out to their desired tutor on the site. We used html in creating the page structure and css in styling the document. I also used an external css to enable me to use fa icons css link https://kit.fontawesome.com/327b6324f1.js". 

### Challenges
My main challenge was getting  storing login credentials as the page is limited to use of a database so most of the data is static.
